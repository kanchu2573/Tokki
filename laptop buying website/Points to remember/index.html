      <div class="processor" id="processor">
        <div class="name"><h1>Processor</h1></div>
        <p>
          Choose a CPU based on intended use (e.g., gaming, content creation).
          <br />
          Ensure compatibility with the motherboard socket (Intel or AMD).
          <br />
          Higher core counts are better for multitasking; higher clock speeds
          are better for single-threaded tasks.
          <br />
          Check for integrated graphics if no GPU is used.
          <br />
          Consider future-proofing with newer generation CPUs. <br />
          Check for overclocking capabilities if you want to push performance
          (available in some CPUs). <br />
          Pay attention to TDP (Thermal Design Power) to choose an adequate
          cooling solution. <br />
          Make sure the CPU supports the desired operating system and
          applications. <br />
          Compare different architectures, as newer ones often provide better
          performance per core. <br />
          Look out for built-in security features in newer processors for added
          protection.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="processor" id="gpu">
        <div class="name"><h1>Graphic Card</h1></div>
        <p>
          Prioritize a GPU that matches your performance needs and monitor
          resolution. <br />
          Ensure it fits within the case’s GPU clearance. <br />
          Check PSU requirements for adequate wattage and connectors. <br />
          Look for VRAM capacity—more VRAM is beneficial for higher resolutions.
          <br />
          Keep in mind cooling needs as GPUs can run hot. <br />
          Consider ray tracing support if interested in high-end gaming visuals.
          <br />
          Check for multiple monitor support if needed for productivity or
          gaming. <br />
          Look at power efficiency, as some GPUs are more power-hungry than
          others. <br />
          Ensure the GPU driver compatibility with your operating system. <br />
          Factor in VR readiness if you plan on using virtual reality
          applications.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="processor" id="ram">
        <div class="name"><h1>Ram</h1></div>
        <p>
          Choose a minimum of 16GB for general use; 32GB+ for intensive tasks.
          <br />
          Verify compatibility with the motherboard (DDR4, DDR5).
          <br />
          Dual-channel kits (2 sticks) often improve performance.
          <br />
          Look for lower latency and higher frequency for better performance.
          <br />
          Ensure enough slots for future upgrades. <br />
          Choose memory from reliable brands for quality and warranty support.
          <br />
          Consider RGB lighting options if aesthetics are important. <br />
          ECC RAM may be beneficial for critical systems, though not common for
          gaming. <br />
          For certain applications, faster RAM can improve performance (e.g.,
          gaming or content creation). <br />
          Match RAM color and design with your build if aesthetics are part of
          your plan.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="processor" id="motherboard">
        <div class="name"><h1>Motherboard</h1></div>
        <p>
          Match the motherboard socket with your CPU (e.g., AM4, LGA 1700).
          <br />
          Select a chipset that supports your needs (e.g., overclocking, PCIe
          lanes). <br />
          Ensure adequate connectivity (USB, SATA, M.2 slots). <br />
          Check for enough RAM slots if upgrading later. <br />
          Choose the form factor (ATX, mATX) based on case compatibility. <br />
          Check for BIOS updates compatibility to support newer CPUs. <br />
          Ensure there’s onboard audio if no separate sound card will be used.
          <br />
          Look for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth if a wireless connection is needed.
          <br />
          Check PCIe slot configuration to accommodate multiple components
          (e.g., GPUs, SSDs). <br />
          Review warranty and support from the manufacturer, as motherboards are
          critical components.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="processor" id="case">
        <div class="name"><h1>Case</h1></div>
        <p>
          Ensure it fits your motherboard size (ATX, mATX, ITX). <br />
          Check clearance for GPU and CPU cooler height. <br />
          Look for adequate airflow and fan mounts. <br />
          Verify front-panel I/O options suit your needs. <br />
          Cable management features can simplify a tidy build. <br />
          Choose a case with dust filters for easier maintenance and cleaner
          airflow. <br />
          Look for tempered glass panels if you want to showcase the interior.
          <br />
          Consider water-cooling support if planning on using an AIO or custom
          loop. <br />
          Check for sound-dampening features if aiming for a quieter build.
          <br />
          Make sure the case has room for future expansions or additional
          components.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="processor" id="storage">
        <div class="name"><h1>Storage</h1></div>
        <p>
          Use an SSD (preferably NVMe) for faster boot and load times. <br />
          HDDs offer more storage for less cost; good for bulk storage. <br />
          Ensure your motherboard supports desired storage types (SATA, M.2).
          <br />
          Plan storage layout based on speed and accessibility. <br />
          Consider upgrading space if needed for future needs. <br />
          Use a fast SSD for the OS and frequently used programs, and an HDD for
          bulk storage. <br />
          Check for RAID support on the motherboard if you want data redundancy.
          <br />
          Use an external backup drive for extra data security. <br />
          Pay attention to the write endurance of SSDs, especially for
          heavy-duty use. <br />
          Plan for drive bays if you want multiple storage devices.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="processor" id="power">
        <div class="name"><h1>Power Supply</h1></div>
        <p>
          Calculate total system power and add some headroom. <br />
          Choose an 80 Plus certified PSU for efficiency. <br />
          Ensure enough PCIe, CPU, and SATA power connectors. <br />
          Modular PSUs help with cable management. <br />
          Avoid low-quality PSUs to ensure component safety. <br />
          Avoid using PSUs close to their max rated wattage to prolong their
          lifespan. <br />
          Ensure the PSU’s physical size fits your case (some are larger or
          smaller). <br />
          Look for a PSU with active or hybrid fan modes to reduce noise at low
          loads. <br />
          A fully modular PSU can make cable management cleaner. <br />
          Consider warranty length; good PSUs often come with long warranties
          (5-10 years).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="processor" id="cooling">
        <div class="name"><h1>Cooling System</h1></div>
        <p>
          Use an appropriate cooler (air or liquid) based on CPU requirements.
          <br />
          Ensure fan or radiator compatibility with the case. <br />
          Set up balanced airflow for effective cooling. <br />
          Additional case fans can improve cooling efficiency. <br />
          Check noise levels if sound is a concern. <br />
          Match the cooler's TDP rating with the CPU’s thermal needs. <br />
          High-end cooling (like liquid cooling) may improve performance for
          overclocking. <br />
          Larger radiators provide better cooling for liquid systems but need
          more space. <br />
          Consider fan sizes—larger fans are generally quieter while moving more
          air. <br />
          Maintain regular cleaning to prevent dust buildup and keep airflow
          efficient.
